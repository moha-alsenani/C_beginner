This repository documents my learning journey in the C programming language. Often regarded as the "father of modern programming languages", C provides the foundational knowledge behind many high-level languages used today. As I transition into the next academic year at the University of Glasgow, C will play a key role in several of my upcoming courses â€” making it essential to strengthen my understanding and skills.
